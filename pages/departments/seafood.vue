                When you walk by the PriceCo Foods seafood counter, it's like a
                trip to Fisherman's Wharf. Our seafood department carries a
                large and fresh-from-the-ocean selection of seafood.

                As the season and weather permits, our seafood department
                showcases excellent fillets and steaks of various fish, from
                halibut to red snapper to fresh mahi mahi.

                We also have fresh crab, shellfish, and prawns! If it's seafood
                you want, then we've got it!
